## Note to Artists

Hi creative person! Interested in contributing to the textures for this mod? üé®

I'm looking for someone to overhaul the images for the following items:

- biomass.png
- shreddedplastic.png (+ block texture)
- shreddedpaper.png (+ block texture)
- shreddedstarch.png (+ block texture)
- shreddedplants.png (+ block texture)
- plasticwaste.png (think trash from the ocean, plastic bottles, colourful fragments etc)
- paperwaste.png (again from the ocean)

And if you're up for something more complex:

- tissuescaffold.png
- emptysyringe.png
- fullsyringe.png
- sample.png
- filament.png (i.e. 3D printer filament)

The main palette used for the blocks/machines in this mod is shown below:

In terms of artistic direction, the mod's design style is inspired roughly by Lego (50%), Astroneer (25%) and WALL-E (25%). Love those things too? This project might be for you!

If I end up using your textures, you will of course receive full credit both on CurseForge and in the mod itself for your work. Sadly as this is a passion project I will not be able to reimburse you monetarily for your time - apologies üòì

If you'd like to have a go at improving these textures let me know on Discord at MoonMan#7432 or via email at moonmanmodding@gmail.com with a few examples of your artwork.

## Thanks ‚ù§
