# Version 1.1.0 - Hydroponics & Lights! üå±

This version provides the Hydroponic Grow Bed and Hydroponic Grow Light.

An alternative to soil-based farming, the Grow Bed allows you to grow crops without getting your hands dirty with all that gross farmland. The Grow Bed requires a steady stream of water to function, provided either through using a bucket of water (lame) or automation (awesome). Get some water in your Grow Bed, and other Grow Beds adjacent to the outflow pipe will fill up too. Want to speed up your üåæüåæüåæ growth? Add growth media! Placing a block of Dirt, Sand, Gravel or Clay in the Grow Bed will boost your plant's growing ability. You can change the water usage and growth modifiers in the mod's Config to make things a bit easier (or more challenging).

The Grow Light is a powered light (requiring RF) that can also accelerate crop growth. Place a Bulb in the light, power it up and let your crops bathe in soothing LED goodness.

Not everything needs to be functional, you know. A Hydroponic Frame is a slimline decorative block to cover any ugly block faces and support your lights. Available only in high-tech gloss white.

# Compatibility
Emerging Technology tentatively works with the following mods:

- Pam's HarvestCraft
- Botania
- Mystical Agriculture
- OpenComputers
- NuclearCraft
- XNET
- AgriCraft (requires some setup)

Untested but likely compatible:
- Ender IO
- Mekanism
- BuildCraft

Currently incompatible with power/crops:
- IndustrialCraft 2 (will be added in future)

The mod should be compatible with any mods whose plants implement IGrowable and IPlantable, but there are bound to be exceptions. In terms of pumping water into the grow beds, this mod should also be compatible with any mod that uses IFluidHandler and CapabilityFluidHandler. Manipulating inventory is available through ItemStackHandler. 

# About üî¨

This mod is in <b>beta</b>, and also my first mod, so please be patient if you find bugs. Post any problems in the Issues tab in this repository. Feel free to also add requests for future updates.

Planned updates to the Hydroponics module include:
- More growth media types
- OpenComputers support

Future modules:
- Plant-based plastics/polymers
- 3D printing
- Artificial meat

This mod is not intended to be the last word on Hydroponics in Minecraft. If you want to make your own hydroponics mod, take this source code and run with it.

I'm a freelance developer with bills to pay, but I will try to keep this mod as updated and bug-free as possible while adding new content. Kind thanks to r/feedthebeast for your support and feedback üòç
