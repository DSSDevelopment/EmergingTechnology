# Version 1.0.0 - Hydroponics! ðŸŒ±

This version provides a single block - the Hydroponic Grow Bed. An alternative to soil-based farming, the Grow Bed allows you to grow crops without getting your hands dirty with all that gross farmland.

The Grow Bed requires a steady stream of water to function, provided either through using a bucket of water (lame) or  automation (awesome). Get some water in your Grow Bed, and other Grow Beds adjacent to the outflow pipe will fill up too!
